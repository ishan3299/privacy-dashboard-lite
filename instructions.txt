It DOES NOT:
- Monitor activity
- Track behavior
- Spy on users
- Access network traffic

================================================
CORE FEATURES (MUST-HAVE)
================================================

1️⃣ HOME DASHBOARD (OVERVIEW)
----------------------------
Provide a friendly, non-technical overview:

- Total apps installed
- Apps with sensitive permissions
- Apps with exported components
- Apps exposing deep links
- Privacy risk distribution (Low / Medium / High)

Risk must be:
- Explained
- Contextual
- Non-judgmental

------------------------------------------------

2️⃣ APP DETAIL SCREEN (CRITICAL)
--------------------------------
For EACH installed app:

Show:
- App icon, name, package
- Declared permissions (grouped & explained)
- Exported activities / services / receivers
- Intent filters
- Deep links & shortcuts (if available)

Each item MUST include:
- Plain-English explanation
- Why it exists
- Whether this is common or unusual

  - Normal
  - Sensitive
  - High-impact

- App-defined actions

NO invocation  
NO automation  
NO exploitation  

------------------------------------------------

5️⃣ SEARCH & FILTERING
---------------------
- Search apps by name
- Filter by:
  - Permission count
  - Exported components
  - Risk level

================================================
QUALITY & PRODUCT BAR
================================================
Before finalizing ANY feature, ask:
- Would a normal user trust this?
- Would Play Store approve this?
- Does this educate without scaring?

If NO → fix it.

================================================
COMMUNICATION RULE
================================================
If ANY feature:
- Risks Play Store rejection
- Violates Android security
- Feels invasive or misleading

STOP.
Ask Ishan Patel.
DO NOT GUESS.

================================================
DELIVERABLES

- Android Studio project
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose code
- Material 3 theme
- Emulator-tested APK
- GitHub-ready repo
