# Privacy Policy for Privacy Dashboard Lite

**Last updated: January 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how Privacy Dashboard Lite ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and discloses your information in connection with your use of our application (the "App").

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

The App operates entirely locally on your device (offline-first). It analyzes the applications installed on your device to provide you with a privacy risk assessment.

### Installed Application Information
To function, the App accesses the list of applications installed on your device (using the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission). This information is processed **only** in the device's volatile memory (RAM) to:
*   Identify installed apps.
*   Analyze their requested permissions.
*   Count their exported components.
*   Calculate a privacy risk score.

This analysis happens in real-time and is **never** sent to any external server or third party.

## 2. Permissions

The App requests the following sensitive permission:
*   **Query All Packages (`android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`):** Required to perform the core function of the app: scanning your installed apps to audit their permissions and privacy risks.

## 3. Data Retention

We do not retain any user data. The analysis results are transient and exist only while the App is running.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
